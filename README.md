## üìî Contribution Guide

### Branching Strategy üåø

Our goal is to maintain a strategy that allows us to continuously deploy features to production.

During the early stages of this project, we will use a variation of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/): we deploy from master automatically to staging, instead of deploying from feature branch to production.

To summarize:

**Very Very Important**

- Always start your work (feature) by branching off `master`.
- Bugfixes and Hotfixes should also be branched out from `master`.
- No code can be pushed directly to `master`.
- Merge/pull requests need to be approved before being merged to `master`.
- Prepend `feature/` to your feature branch name.
- Prepend `bugfix/` to your bugfix branch name.
- Prepend `hotfix/` to your hotfix branch name.
- Feature/bugfix/hotfix branches should be deleted after merging.
- Master is automatically deployed to staging and should be considered the one source of truth.

- **Release strategy TBD.**

### Before Pushing your code ‚ùó

To avoid having to run the CI build more than needed, run these commands before you push your code:

- Format ( `yarn run format` )
- Validate ( `yarn run validate`)

Now you can push at ease üòé

### Merge Request Title format

`#<asana-task-id>: Title`

This will update the Asana task/ticket with a link directly to your merge request.
